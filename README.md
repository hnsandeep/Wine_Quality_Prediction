# Wine_Quality_Prediction
Bharat Internship Machine Learning Task 3


## About Task  ##
In this wine quality prediction machine learning project, we utilize linear regression to model the relationship between various chemical attributes of wines and their quality scores. By training the model on a labeled dataset of wine samples, we aim to predict the quality of new wines based on their chemical composition.
